How to make 
your own Cards 
Against Humanity

1.  Download this PDF and take it to your local 

print shop.

2.  Have the shop print out the game on heavy 

white cardstock (usually 80-pound or 
higher). Although the cards are black and 
white, you’ll get a nicer result if you can 
convince them to use a color printer.

3.  For added fanciness, you can print black 

on the back of the question cards to make 
them easier to tell apart.

4.  Cut the cards to size using a large paper 

cutter. The more precise you are, the easier 
they’ll be to handle later.

5. When you’re done, we recommend 

purchasing a clear model 102C AMAC box 
(there’s a great one for sale at the Container 
Store) for storing your cards.

Basic Rules

House Rules (cont.)

To start the game, each player draws ten white cards.

The player who most recently pooped begins as the Card Czar 
and draws a black card. If Hugh Jackman is playing, he goes first, 
regardless of how recently he pooped.

The Card Czar reads the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase on the 
black card out loud. Everyone else answers the question or fills in 
the blank by passing one white card, face down, to the Card Czar.

The Card Czar then shuffles all the answers and reads each card 
combination out loud to the group. The Card Czar should re-read 
the black card before presenting each answer. Finally, the Card 
Czar picks the funniest play, and whoever submitted it gets  
one point.

After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar and everyone 
draws back up to ten white cards.

Some black cards say “PICK 2” on the bottom. To answer these, 
each player plays two white cards in combination. IMPORTANT: 
Arrange them in the order that the Card Czar should read them—
play the first card face down, and then play the second card face 
down on top of it.

Gambling

If you have more than one white card that you think could win a 
round, you can bet one of your points to play an extra white card. 
If you win, you keep the point. If you lose, whoever wins gets the 
point you wagered.

House Rules                                                  

Cards Against Humanity is meant to be remixed. Here are some of 
our favorite ways to pimp out the rules:

Rando Cardrissian: Every round, pick one random white card from 
the pile and place it into play. This card belongs to an imaginary 
player named Rando Cardrissian, and if he wins the game, all 
players go home in a state of everlasting shame. 

Happy Ending: When you’re ready to end the game, play the 
“Make a haiku” black card. This is the official ceremonial ending of 
a good game of Cards Against Humanity. Note: Haikus don’t need 
to follow the 5-7-5 form. They just have to be read dramatically.

Never Have I Ever: At any time, players may discard cards that 
they don’t understand, but they must confess their ignorance to the 
group and suffer the resulting humiliation.

Wheaton’s Law: Each round, the Card Czar draws two black 
cards, chooses the one they’d prefer to play, and puts the other at 
the bottom of the black card pile. 

Rebooting the Universe: At any time, players may trade in a point 
to return as many white cards as they’d like to the deck and draw 
back to ten.

Packing Heat: For Pick 2s, all players draw an extra card before 
playing the hand to open up more options.

Meritocracy: Instead of passing clockwise, the role of Card Czar 
passes to the winner of the previous round.

Smooth Operator: If a player slips a card from their hand into 
conversation without anyone noticing, they may trade it for one 
point. If the player is called out, they lose a point. If this rule is 
confusing, you’re taking this game too seriously. 

Tie Breaker: If the Card Czar can’t decide between two white 
cards, they may declare a Tie Breaker. In the event of a Tie Breaker, 
the more conventionally attractive player wins.

Chubby Bunny: Players crumple up their winning cards and keep 
them in their mouths as points.

Freaky Friday: Players play Cards Against Humanity while wearing 
their mothers’ underpants.

Hard Mode: Play Cards Against Humanity while raising four kids, 
dealing with chronic back pain, and waiting tables at Chili’s. Bonus! 
For an added challenge, try being gay or black.

Russian Roulette: The Card Czar takes out a revolver. They place 
one bullet at random in the cylinder, spin it, and close it. They then 
hold the gun to their head and pull the trigger. If the Card Czar 
survives, they defiantly place the gun in the center of the table 
and eye the other players, challenging them to pick up the gun “if 
they’re man enough.” The Card Czar wins a point.

Hail to the Chief: A player may earn a point at any time by 
announcing candidacy for and successfully being elected President 
of the United States of America.

Race to the Moon: All players begin masturbating immediately. 
Then what happens? 

Smoke Opium and Play Cards Against Humanity: Great idea!

Wait for Godot: At the start of the game, instead of drawing a 
hand, players stare at the pile of white cards. After an indeterminate 
amount of time, players move their gaze to the pile of black cards. 
The game doesn’t begin. How can it begin? It has already ended. 
In the gloom, players shift their cloudy gaze from pile to pile. Is it 
a trick of the light, or do the black cards and white cards seem to 
converge in an indistinguishable grayness? Mote by mote, dust 
settles on the cards. Nobody accumulates points. Nobody wins.
